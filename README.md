# ASSIGNMENT-4
# Task-1 deals with designing a Python program that opens and reads a text file named sample.txt, prints its content line by line and handles errors if the file doesn't exist.
# Task-2 has a Python program that takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt, appends additional user input data to the same file, reads and displays the final content to the file.
# NOTE- I have attached the "sample.txt" and "output.txt" text files as well for your reference.
